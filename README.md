# organism_sim

A **2D top-down evolving organism simulation** inspired by *The Bibites*.

This project explores how **morphology, neural control, and behavior can emerge together**
using growth grammars, local neurons, and simple physics — without hard-coding limbs,
movement, or intelligence.

Organisms grow appendages, add sensors and actuators, and evolve neural wiring while
remaining visually interpretable and simulation-friendly.

## Core Goals

- 🧬 **Growth-first design**  
  Appendages emerge from grammar rules, not predefined body plans.

- 🧠 **Morphology-safe neural control**  
  Neurons attach to body parts; adding limbs does not break the brain.

- 🧱 **2D top-down visualization**  
  Everything is visible, debuggable, and understandable in real time.

- 🔁 **Evolution over training**  
  Intelligence emerges through mutation and selection, not backprop.

- ⚙️ **Practical performance**  
  Designed to scale to hundreds of agents at 60 FPS.
